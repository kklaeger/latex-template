# LaTeX Template 

An easy to use LaTeX template for academic theses or papers

### Notice:

If Texmaker is used as editor the following settings simplify the usage:

- Update the Quick Build command (F1): "Options" > "Configure Texmaker" > "Quick Build" > Activate "PdfLaTeX + Bib(la)tex + PdfLaTeX (x2) + View Pdf" (second entry) 

- The Quick Build command (F1) has to be executed in "document.tex". Alternatively: "Options" > Define Current Document as "Master Document" (has to be done every time Texmaker is started).
